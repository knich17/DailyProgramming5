# Day 5 - Hello World Genetic Algorithm
[Found at /r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/40rs67/20160113_challenge_249_intermediate_hello_world/)

## Problem Description
Use either an Evolutionary or Genetic Algorithm to evolve a solution to the fitness functions provided!

### Input description

The input string should be the target string you want to evolve the initial random solution into.
The target string (and therefore input) will be
'Hello, world!'
However, you want your program to initialize the process by randomly generating a string of the same length as the input. The only thing you want to use the input for is to determine the fitness of your function, so you don't want to just cheat by printing out the input string!

## Solution
To be attempted in C#.
